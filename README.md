# Container Yard Reconfiguration

This repository contains a program designed to reconfigure containers within a yard. The primary objective is to optimize the arrangement of containers to either place them in designated target locations or comply with a maximum yard height constraint. This project addresses the challenges of container stacking and relocation in a limited space, ensuring efficient and accessible positioning.
